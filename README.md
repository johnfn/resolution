# resolution

A Clojure game libary.

## Usage

Until I write this more throughly, see sample.clj.

## Explanation

Resolution is a library designed to make writing games in clojure easier. 

It is being developed concurrently with a sample game, with the uninspired name Sample. The reason for this is twofold: it shows the correct useage of Resolution, and it directs my development towards the most important features.
